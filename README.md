<h3> Introduction with Ruby - 1lab</h3>
<p>1 Task: <br/><pre>
          1.&emsp;Hello world
          2.&emsp;Accept the username as a program argument.Say hello to the user using string formatting. 
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Ask what language is the user's favorite, in case it is ruby, answer that the user is a sucker, 
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;otherwise be sure to answer that soon it will be ruby and put 
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;different comments for several languages.
          3.&emsp;Ask user enter ruby language command and OS command. Execute ruby and OS command</pre>
</p>
<p> 2 Task:<br/><pre>
          1.&emsp;Find the sum of prime divisors of a number.
          2.&emsp;Find the number of odd digits of a number greater than 3
          3.&emsp;Find the multiple of such divisors of a number, the sum of the digits less than 
          &emsp; &emsp;the sum of the digits of the original number.
</pre></p>
<p> 3 Task:<br/><pre>
          1.&emsp;Write methods that find the minimum, elements, number of the first 
          &emsp; &emsp;positive element. Each operation in a separate method. Solve the problem using loops (for and while)
          2.&emsp;Write a program that takes two values as an argument. The first
          &emsp; &emsp;value tells which of the methods of task 1 to execute, the second one 
          &emsp; &emsp;tells where to read the list from where the file address should be written 
          &emsp; &emsp;as an argument. Next, you need to read the array and execute the method.
